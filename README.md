# Data-Journalism-Q6

This is a smaple mark down file that I can type 

I picked the question about how many times it's acceptable to get up during a 6-hour flight because 
Iâ€™ve personally wondered how many times it's considered acceptable to get up during a long flight. 

The chart reveals that most people think it's acceptable to get up **two or three times** during a flight, with **296** people choosing "three times" and **277** choosing "twice." Only **13** believe it's not okay to get up at all, showing that passengers generally understand the need for movement during long flights.
